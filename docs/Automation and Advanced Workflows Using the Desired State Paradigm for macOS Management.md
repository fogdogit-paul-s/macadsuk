### Key Takeaways:

Define the Desired State
- What apps are installed?
- What settings are configured:
	- by MDM payload?
	- by Script?
- What compliance policies?
- What data do I need reported and how do I report it?
- What different personas and use cases must I support?

Create Independent Resources:
- Use targeted configurations instead of monolithic scripts
- Have a minimized any dependencies?
- How am I reporting that the configuration is correct?
-   ﻿Which personas does this apply to?
-   ﻿﻿Where must I consider user experience?

Automation will Handle Drift:
- Can my toolset proactively determine if the desired state is not met?
- ﻿﻿Can my toolset remediate device drift automatically?
- Can my toolset guide end users to remediate device drift?
- Can my toolset notify admins of drift in managed devices?
- Do I have insight into all the information I need?
